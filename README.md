# react-01-boilerplate

This boilerplate is live at following address

https://react-01-boilerplate.herokuapp.com/

### Details
This project is build using expressjs generator. Its uses Nodejs/expressjs as backend and react for front end.

I intensionally did not use create-react-app here because of following reasons
*  Create-react-app runs on a port and if I have to use it with existing backend, I would have to run it backend as well as frontend separatetly.
*  Using webpack, babel gives you much more clairfy on application stucture.
